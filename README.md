# Data-Analysis-with-Polars
Inspired by [Hands on Data Analysis with Pandas: 2nd Edition](Hands-On-Data-Analysis-with-Pandas-2nd-edition), this repository provides the exercises in the original work implemented with [polars](https://pola.rs) instead of pandas. On occasion, we would also benchmark and compare the speed between polars and pandas.
